                    the software application (the “Software”) which provides users with hand recognition technology to
                    identify a suitable gun size for each individual user (the “Services”). The Software and the
                    Services are made available to you only under the following terms of service (the “Terms”).</p>

                <p>By accessing or using this Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be
                    bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not use or access

                    these Terms each time you use the Software because your use of the Software after the posting of
                    changes will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Agreement to these Terms also constitutes

                <br>

                <h4>Biometric Information Collection</h4>
                <p>The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following
                    conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear
                    in singular or in plural.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Definitions</h4>
                <p>“Biometric Data” is considered any biometric identifiers and biometric information, including a
                    retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry, regardless of how it
                    is captured, converted, stored, or shared, which is used to identify an individual. In order to
                    provide the Services, we must collect, store, and use Biometric Data. To the extent we collect,
                    capture, or otherwise obtain Biometric Data relating to a user, we will inform the user that we are
                    collecting, capturing, or otherwise obtaining the user’s Biometric Data. We will also inform the
                    user of the storage and transmission of the user’s Biometric Data for the user’s use of the
                    Services. By opting into the use of the Services, you are agreeing to and authorizing our use and
                    transmission of the Biometric Data.</p>
                <p>We will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from user’s Biometric Data, except for the fees
                    collected for use of the Services. We will not disclose or disseminate any Biometric Data to anyone
                    other than the user unless such disclosure is required by state or federal law or municipal
                    ordinance or such disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court
                    of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>We shall retain user’s Biometric Data until the Services are complete or for 1 year following the
                    user’s last interaction with Shortica. We will use a reasonable standard of care to store,
                    transmit, and protect from disclosure any paper or electronic biometric data collected.</p>
                <br>

                    access and use the Software. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without notice to you,
                    to revise the Services available on the Software and to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect
                    of the Software. We may also impose rules for and limits on use of the Software or restrict your

                <br>

                <h4>Termination of Service</h4>
                <p>We may terminate the Services at any time and such termination shall be effective immediately. You
                    may terminate the Services by providing us with sixty (60) days written notice of intent to
                    terminate. If the termination is due to a material breach by us, you must provide written notice of
                    the breach and allow a thirty (30) day cure period. If the Services are terminated before the end of
                    the then-current term (unless the termination was due to a material breach by Shortica),
                    any outstanding and future payments due to us shall become immediately due and payable. If you opted
                    for an annual payment of any fees, no refund will be issued in the event of early termination.</p>
